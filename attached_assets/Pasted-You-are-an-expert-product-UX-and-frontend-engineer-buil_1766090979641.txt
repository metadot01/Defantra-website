You are an expert product, UX, and frontend engineer building a marketing website for a B2B AI customs platform called Defantra.
The full, approved website copy and company description is in the attached document in this Replit project.
Task:
1. Read and understand the attached website content file.
2. Design an information architecture (pages, sections, navigation) that uses all that content in a clear, modern way.
3. Implement a complete responsive website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if needed) that reflects this content and structure.
1. Content and context
• The company is focused on:
• AI‑powered HS code classification with confidence scoring.
• Human‑in‑the‑loop workflows for edge cases.
• Immutable audit records for all customs decisions.
• Serving customs brokers and freight forwarders first, with future expansion.
• The full approved copy is stored in this project as a document.
• Action: Locate the document in the Replit filesystem (for example:  content/website-copy.txt  or a similarly named file attached to this Repl) and treat that as the single source of truth.
• Do not invent major new sections; only add small connective phrases if needed to make the layout readable.
2. Site structure to create
Create a multi‑page site with at least:
• Home – High‑level value proposition, hero section, social proof, and key benefits.
• Product / Platform – Clear breakdown of features such as HS code classification, human‑in‑the‑loop, audit trail, risk assessment, integrations.
• Solutions – Tailored sections for customs brokers and freight forwarders (and any other roles mentioned in the content).
• How It Works – Step‑by‑step flow that reflects Defantra’s principles: verifiable trust, regulated scale, and explicit responsibility.
• Resources / Blog – If the content mentions articles, insights, or documentation, create a simple listing page and a template for a single article.
• About – Company mission, vision, and why responsible AI in customs matters.
• Contact / Request Demo – Form for leads with fields: name, company, role, email, phone (optional), volume of declarations per month, and a free‑text message.
Use a top navigation bar with these pages and a persistent “Request Demo” button. On mobile, use a hamburger menu.
3. Design requirements
• Style: clean, modern B2B SaaS, with emphasis on trust and compliance.
• Color palette:
• Primary: deep blue or navy (trust/compliance).
• Accent: teal or green (AI, efficiency).
• Background: light grey or off‑white.
• Typography:
• Use a modern sans‑serif font pairing for headings and body text.
• Make headings bold and easy to scan.
• Layout:
• Full‑width hero with headline, sub‑headline, primary CTA (“Request Demo”) and secondary CTA (“Download Overview PDF” or similar if mentioned).
• Sections for features and benefits using cards or icon rows.
• Use comparison/feature tables when highlighting differences such as “Manual vs Defantra”, or “Brokers vs Forwarders use cases” if the content supports it.
• Visuals:
• Include illustrative elements that suggest dashboards, workflows, and audit logs (using simple shapes and components, not real data).
• Keep everything fully implementable in HTML/CSS (no dependence on external design tools).
4. Implementation details
• Stack: plain HTML + CSS + minimal JavaScript (no heavy frameworks), unless you identify a simple, built‑in Replit template that is clearly superior.
• File structure:
•  index.html  – Home page.
•  product.html  – Product/platform page.
•  solutions.html  – Solutions page.
•  how-it-works.html  – How it works.
•  resources.html  and a sample  resource-detail.html  or similar.
•  about.html  – About page.
•  contact.html  – Contact / Request demo.
•  assets/css/styles.css  – Central stylesheet.
•  assets/js/main.js  – Only if needed for interactivity (e.g., mobile nav, smooth scrolling, simple form validation).
• Make the header and footer consistent across all pages.
• Ensure the layout is fully responsive down to 360px width.
• Implement semantic HTML:  <header> ,  <nav> ,  <main> ,  <section> ,  <footer> , etc.
5. Use the attached content correctly
• Parse the attached content file and:
• Map each main section or heading in the document to a logical page and section on the site.
• Preserve product terminology exactly as written.
• Use bullet lists, sub‑sections, or cards to make long paragraphs easier to scan, but do not change the core meaning.
• If some points don’t fit into the main pages, create an “Additional details” section under Resources or About instead of dropping them.
6. Forms and basic interactions
• Implement the Request Demo / Contact form in  contact.html .
• Include HTML5 form validation ( required  attributes, email type, etc.).
• For now, simulate submission with a JavaScript handler that:
• Prevents default submission.
• Shows a success message banner at the top of the form.
• Logs the form data to the browser console so it is easy to wire to a backend later.
7. Accessibility and best practices
• Ensure sufficient color contrast for text.
• Add  alt  text to all meaningful images or icons.
• Make navigation keyboard accessible.
• Use logical heading hierarchy ( h1  per page, then  h2 ,  h3 , etc.).
8. Final checks
• Once you generate the site, verify that:
• All navigation links work and point to the right HTML files.
• The layout looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
• All major ideas from the attached content are visible and easy to find.
• If anything is unclear from the content, make reasonable assumptions and keep the structure flexible so it can be edited later.
Now, read the attached website content file in this Repl, design the information architecture, and then generate all the HTML, CSS, and JS files needed for this multi‑page site.
